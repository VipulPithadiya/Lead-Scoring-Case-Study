Problem Statement

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. They have process of form filling on their website after which the company that individual as a lead. After obtaining these leads, sales team members begin calling, emailing, and so on.Some of the leads convert during this process, but the majority do not. At X education, the lead conversion rate is typically 30%. This implies that just around 30 of the leads, say, that they generate each day will actually be converted. The organization wants to find the most potential leads, or "Hot Leads," in order to streamline this procedure.The lead conversion rate should increase if they are able to locate this group of leads because the sales staff will now be spending more time corresponding with the prospects rather than calling everyone.

Business Objective

Lead X wants us to create a model that assigns a score to each lead ranging from 0 to 100. So they can find hot leads while also increasing their conversion rate. The CEO hopes to reach a lead conversion rate of 80%. They want the model to be able to manage future limitations as well, such as peak time actions, how to use all available manpower, and what measures should be taken once the target is met.
